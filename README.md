I recently participated in PwC's virtual job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to learn about how to use PowerBI more effectively.

I practiced creating a Power BI dashboard for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.

Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working with data visualization using Microsoft PowerBI for diversity and inclusion in the corporate world, and I’m excited to apply these skills at a company like PwC.
